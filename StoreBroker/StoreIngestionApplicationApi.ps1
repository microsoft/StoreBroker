function Get-Applications
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves all of the applications associated with this developer account.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Retrieves all of the applications associated with this developer account.
        For formatted output of this result, consider piping the result into Format-Applications.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER MaxResults
        The number of applications that should be returned in the query.
        Defaults to 100.

    .PARAMETER StartAt
        The 0-based index (of all apps within your account) that the returned
        results should start returning from.
        Defaults to 0.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER GetAll
        If this switch is specified, the cmdlet will automatically loop in batches
        to get all of the applications in this account.  Using this will ignore
        the provided value for -StartAt, but will use the value provided for
        -MaxResults as its per-query limit.
        WARNING: This might take a while depending on how many applications are in
        your developer account.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-Applications
        Gets the first 100 applications associated with this developer account,
        with the console window showing progress while awaiting the response
        from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-Applications -NoStatus
        Gets the first 100 applications associated with this developer account,
        but the request happens in the foreground and there is no additional status
        shown to the user until a response is returned from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-Applications 500
        Gets the first 500 applications associated with this developer account,
        with the console window showing progress while awaiting the response
        from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-Applications 10 -StartAt 50
        Gets the next 10 apps in the developer account starting with the 51st app
        (since it's a 0-based index) with the console window showing progress while
        awaiting the response from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        $apps = Get-Applications
        Retrieves the first 100 applications associated with this developer account,
        and saves the results in a variable called $apps that can be used for
        further processing.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-Applications -NoStatus | Format-Applications
        Pretty-print the results by piping them into Format-Applications.

    .PARAMETER AppId
        The Application ID for the application that you want to retrieve the information
        about.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionId
        The specific submission that you want to retrieve the information about.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-ApplicationSubmissionStatus 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789

        Gets the status for this application submission, with the console window showing
        progress while awaiting the response from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-ApplicationSubmissionStatus 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789 -NoStatus

        Gets the status for this application submission,  but the request happens in the
        foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user until a response
        is returned from the REST request.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Deletes the specified application submission from a developer account.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Deletes the specified application submission from a developer account.
        An app can only have a single "pending" submission at any given time,
        and submissions cannot be modified via the REST API once started.
        Therefore, before a new application submission can be submitted,

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a submission for an existing application on the developer account.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a submission for an existing application on the developer account.
        This app must already have at least one *published* submission completed via
        the website in order for this function to work.
        You cannot submit a new application submission if there is an existing pending
        application submission for $AppId already.  You can use -Force to work around
        this.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER AppId
        The Application ID for the application that the new submission is for.

    .PARAMETER ExistingPackageRolloutAction
        If the current published submission is making use of gradual package rollout,
        a new submission cannot be created until that existing submission is either
        halted or finalized.  To streamline the behavior in this scenario, you can
        indicate what action should be performed to that existing submission's package
        rollout prior to starting a new submission.

    .PARAMETER Force
        If this switch is specified, any existing pending submission for AppId
        will be removed before continuing with creation of the new submission.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        New-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 -NoStatus

        Creates a new application submission for app 0ABCDEF12345 that is an exact clone of the currently
        published application submission, but the request happens in the foreground
        and there is no additional status shown to the user until a response is returned from the
        REST request.
        If successful, will return back the PSCustomObject representing the newly created
        application submission.

    .EXAMPLE
        New-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 -Force

        First checks for any existing pending submission for the app with ID 0ABCDEF12345.
        If one is found, it will be removed.  After that check has completed, this will create
        a new application submission for app 0ABCDEF12345 that is an exact clone of the currently
        published application submission, with the console window showing progress while awaiting
        the response from the REST request.
        If successful, will return back the PSCustomObject representing the newly created

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a new submission for an existing application on the developer account
        by cloning the existing submission and modifying specific parts of it.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a new submission for an existing application on the developer account
        by cloning the existing submission and modifying specific parts of it. The
        parts that will be modified depend solely on the switches that are passed in.

        This app must already have at least one *published* submission completed via
        the website in order for this function to work.
        You cannot submit a new application submission if there is an existing pending
        application submission for $AppId already.  You can use -Force to work around
        this.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER AppId
        The Application ID for the application that the new submission is for.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionDataPath
        The file containing the JSON payload for the application submission.

    .PARAMETER PackagePath
        If provided, this package will be uploaded after the submission has been successfully
        created.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishMode
        Indicates how the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishDate
        Indicates when the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        Specifying a value here is only valid when TargetPublishMode is set to 'SpecificDate'.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.  Users should provide this in local time and it
        will be converted automatically to UTC.

    .PARAMETER Visibility
        Indicates the store visibility of the app once the submission has been published.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER ExistingPackageRolloutAction
        If the current published submission is making use of gradual package rollout,
        a new submission cannot be created until that existing submission is either
        halted or finalized.  To streamline the behavior in this scenario, you can
        indicate what action should be performed to that existing submission's package
        rollout prior to starting a new submission.

    .PARAMETER PackageRolloutPercentage
        If specified, this submission will use gradual package rollout, setting their
        initial rollout percentage to be the indicated amount.

    .PARAMETER IsMandatoryUpdate
        Indicates whether you want to treat the packages in this submission as mandatory
        for self-installing app updates.

    .PARAMETER MandatoryUpdateEffectiveDate
        The date and time when the packages in this submission become mandatory. It is
        not required to provide a value for this when using IsMandatoryUpdate, however
        this value will be ignored if specified and IsMandatoryUpdate is not also provided.
        Users should provide this in local time and it will be converted automatically to UTC.

    .PARAMETER AutoCommit
        If this switch is specified, will automatically commit the submission
        (which starts the certification process) once the Package has been uploaded
        (if PackagePath was specified), or immediately after the submission has been modified.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionId
        If a submissionId is provided, instead of trying to clone the currently published
        submission and operating against that clone, this will operate against an already
        existing pending submission (that was likely cloned previously).

    .PARAMETER Force
        If this switch is specified, any existing pending submission for AppId
        will be removed before continuing with creation of the new submission.

    .PARAMETER AddPackages
        Causes the packages that are listed in SubmissionDataPath to be added to the package listing
        in the final, patched submission.  This switch is mutually exclusive with ReplacePackages.

    .PARAMETER ReplacePackages
        Causes any existing packages in the cloned submission to be removed and only the packages
        that are listed in SubmissionDataPath will be in the final, patched submission.
        This switch is mutually exclusive with AddPackages.

    .PARAMETER UpdateListings
        Replaces the listings array in the final, patched submission with the listings array
        from SubmissionDataPath.  Ensures that the images originally part of each listing in the
        cloned submission are marked as "PendingDelete" in the final, patched submission.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        Updates fields under the "Publish Mode and Visibility" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath: targetPublishMode,
        targetPublishDate, and visibility.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePricingAndAvailability
        Updates fields under the "Pricing and Availability" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath:  pricing,
        allowTargetFutureDeviceFamilies, allowMicrosoftDecideAppAvailabilityToFutureDeviceFamilies,
        and enterpriseLicensing.

    .PARAMETER UpdateAppProperties
        Updates fields under the "App Properties" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath: applicationCategory,
        hardwarePreferences, hasExternalInAppProducts, meetAccessibilityGuidelines,
        canInstallOnRemovableMedia, automaticBackupEnabled, and isGameDvrEnabled.

    .PARAMETER UpdateNotesForCertification
        Updates the notesForCertification field using the value from SubmissionDataPath.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json"
        Creates a new application submission for app 0ABCDEF12345 that is a clone of the currently
        published submission.  Even though "c:\foo.json" was provided, because no switches
        were specified to indicate what to copy from it, the cloned submission was not further
        modified, and is thus still an exact copy of the currently published submission.
        If successful, will return back the pending submission id and url that should be
        used with Upload-SubmissionPackage.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json" -AddPackages -NoStatus
        Creates a new application submission for app 0ABCDEF12345 that is a clone of the currently
        published submission.  The packages listed in "c:\foo.json" will be added to the list
        of packages that should be used by the submission.  The request happens in the foreground
        and there is no additional status shown to the user until a response is returned from the
        REST request.  If successful, will return back the pending submission id and url that
        should be used with Upload-SubmissionPackage.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json" -Force -UpdateListings -UpdatePricingAndAvailability
        First checks for any existing pending submission for the app with ID 0ABCDEF12345.
        If one is found, it will be removed.  After that check has completed, this will create
        a new application submission for app 0ABCDEF12345 that is a clone of the currently published
        submission.  The "Pricing and Availability" fields of that cloned submission will be modified to
        reflect the values that are in "c:\foo.json".
        If successful, will return back the pending submission id and url that should be
        used with Upload-SubmissionPackage.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json" "c:\foo.zip" -AutoCommit -SubmissionId 1234567890123456789 -AddPackages
        Retrieves submission 1234567890123456789 from app 0ABCDEF12345, updates the package listing
        to include the packages that are contained in "c:\foo.json."  If successful, this then
        attempts to upload "c:\foo.zip" as the package content for the submission.  If that
        is also successful, it then goes ahead and commits the submission so that the certification
        process can start. The pending submission id and url that were used with with
        Upload-SubmissionPackage are still returned in this scenario, even though the
        upload url can no longer actively be used.

    .OUTPUTS
        An array of the following two objects:
            System.String - The id for the new pending submission
            System.String - The URL that the package needs to be uploaded to.

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Modifies a cloned application submission by copying the specified data from the
        provided "new" submission.  Returns the final, patched submission JSON.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Modifies a cloned application submission by copying the specified data from the
        provided "new" submission.  Returns the final, patched submission JSON.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER ClonedSubmisson
        The JSON that was returned by the Store API when the application submission was cloned.

    .PARAMETER NewSubmission
        The JSON for the new/updated application submission.  The only parts from this submission
        that will be copied to the final, patched submission will be those specified by the
        switches.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishMode
        Indicates how the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from NewSubmission if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishDate
        Indicates when the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        Specifying a value here is only valid when TargetPublishMode is set to 'SpecificDate'.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from NewSubmission if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.  Users should provide this in local time and it
        will be converted automatically to UTC.

    .PARAMETER Visibility
        Indicates the store visibility of the app once the submission has been published.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from NewSubmission if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER PackageRolloutPercentage
        If specified, this submission will use gradual package rollout, setting their
        initial rollout percentage to be the indicated amount.

    .PARAMETER IsMandatoryUpdate
        Indicates whether you want to treat the packages in this submission as mandatory
        for self-installing app updates.

    .PARAMETER MandatoryUpdateEffectiveDate
        The date and time when the packages in this submission become mandatory. It is
        not required to provide a value for this when using IsMandatoryUpdate, however
        this value will be ignored if specified and IsMandatoryUpdate is not also provided.
        Users should provide this in local time and it will be converted automatically to UTC.

    .PARAMETER AddPackages
        Causes the packages that are listed in SubmissionDataPath to be added to the package listing
        in the final, patched submission.  This switch is mutually exclusive with ReplacePackages.

    .PARAMETER ReplacePackages
        Causes any existing packages in the cloned submission to be removed and only the packages
        that are listed in SubmissionDataPath will be in the final, patched submission.
        This switch is mutually exclusive with AddPackages.

    .PARAMETER UpdateListings
        Replaces the listings array in the final, patched submission with the listings array
        from NewSubmission.  Ensures that the images originally part of each listing in the
        ClonedSubmission are marked as "PendingDelete" in the final, patched submission.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        Updates fields under the "Publish Mode and Visibility" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath: targetPublishMode,
        targetPublishDate, and visibility.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePricingAndAvailability
        Updates fields under the "Pricing and Availability" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath: targetPublishMode,
        targetPublishDate, visibility, pricing, allowTargetFutureDeviceFamilies,
        allowMicrosoftDecideAppAvailabilityToFutureDeviceFamilies, and enterpriseLicensing.

    .PARAMETER UpdateAppProperties
        Updates fields under the "App Properties" category in the PackageTool config file.
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath: applicationCategory,
        hardwarePreferences, hasExternalInAppProducts, meetAccessibilityGuidelines,
        canInstallOnRemovableMedia, automaticBackupEnabled, and isGameDvrEnabled.

    .PARAMETER UpdateNotesForCertification
        Updates the notesForCertification field using the value from SubmissionDataPath.

    .EXAMPLE
        $patchedSubmission = Prepare-ApplicationSubmission $clonedSubmission $jsonContent
        Because no switches were specified, ($patchedSubmission -eq $clonedSubmission).

    .EXAMPLE
        $patchedSubmission = Prepare-ApplicationSubmission $clonedSubmission $jsonContent -AddPackages
        $patchedSubmission will be identical to $clonedSubmission, however all of the packages that
        were contained in $jsonContent will have also been added to the package array.

    .EXAMPLE
        $patchedSubmission = Prepare-ApplicationSubmission $clonedSubmission $jsonContent -AddPackages -UpdateListings
        $patchedSubmission will be contain the listings and packages that were part of $jsonContent,
        but the rest of the submission content will be identical to what had been in $clonedSubmission.
        Additionally, any images that were part of listings from $clonedSubmission will still be
        listed in $patchedSubmission, but their file status will have been changed to "PendingDelete".

        Replaces the content of an existing application submission with the supplied
        submission content.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Replaces the content of an existing application submission with the supplied
        submission content.

        This should be called after having cloned an application submission via
        New-ApplicationSubmission.

        The ID of the submission being updated/replaced will be inferred by the
        submissionId defined in UpdatedSubmission.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER AppId
        The Application ID for the application that the submission is for.

    .PARAMETER UpdatedSubmission
        The updated application submission content that should be used to replace the
        existing submission content.  The Submission ID will be determined from this.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER FlightId
        This optional parameter, if provided, will tream the submission being replaced as
        a flight submission as opposed to the regular app published submission.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 $submissionBody

        Inspects $submissionBody to retrieve the id of the submission in question, and then replaces
        the entire content of that existing submission with the content specified in $submissionBody.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 $submissionBody -NoStatus

        Inspects $submissionBody to retrieve the id of the submission in question, and then replaces
        the entire content of that existing submission with the content specified in $submissionBody.
        The request happens in the foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user
        until a response is returned from the REST request.

    .OUTPUTS
        A PSCustomObject containing the JSON of the updated application submission.

        Once committed, it is necessary to wait for the submission to either complete or fail
        the approval process before a new application submission can be created/submitted.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

        for publication, with the console window showing progress while awaiting
        the response from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Commit-ApplicationSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789 -NoStatus
        Marks the pending submission 1234567890123456789 to start the approval process
        for publication, but the request happens in the foreground and there is no
        additional status shown to the user until a response is returned from the REST
        request.

    .NOTES
        This uses the "Complete" verb to avoid Powershell import module warnings, but this
        actually only *commits* the submission.  The decision to publish or not is based
        entirely on the contents of the payload included when calling New-ApplicationSubmission.

        Updates the package rollout percentage for the specified application submission.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Updates the package rollout percentage for the specified application submission.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER AppId
        The Application ID for the application that has the package rollout information
        you are interested in.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionId
        The ID of the published submission that has the package rollout information that
        you are interested in.

    .PARAMETER Percentage
        The new percentage that should be applied to the submission's package rollout.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmissionPackageRollout 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789 20

        Updates the package rollout information for submission 1234567890123456789
        of application 0ABCDEF12345 to be set to 20%.  The console window will show
        progress while awaiting the response from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-ApplicationSubmissionPackageRollout 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789 50.5 -NoStatus

        Updates the package rollout information for submission 1234567890123456789
        of application 0ABCDEF12345 to be set to 50.5%.  The request happens in the
        foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user until a response
        is returned from the REST request.
