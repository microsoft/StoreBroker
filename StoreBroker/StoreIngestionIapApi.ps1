function Get-InAppProducts
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves all IAP's associated across all applications for this
        developer account.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Retrieves all IAP's associated across all applications for this
        developer account.
        Pipe the result of this command into Format-InAppProducts for a
        pretty-printed display of the results.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER MaxResults
        The number of IAP's that should be returned in the query.
        Defaults to 100.

    .PARAMETER StartAt
        The 0-based index (of all IAP's) that the returned results should
        start returning from.
        Defaults to 0.

    .PARAMETER GetAll
        If this switch is specified, the cmdlet will automatically loop in batches
        to get all of the IAP's for this developer account (all applications).
        Using this will ignore the provided value for -StartAt, but will use the
        value provided for -MaxResults as its per-query limit.
        WARNING: This might take a while depending on how many applications and
        IAP's are in your developer account.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-InAppProducts

        Gets all of the IAP's associated with all applications in this developer account,
        with the console window showing progress while awaiting for the response
        from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-InAppProducts -NoStatus

        Gets all of the IAP's associated with all applications in this developer account,
        but the request happens in the foreground and there is no additional status
        shown to the user until a response is returned from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        $iaps = Get-InAppProducts

        Retrieves all of the IAP's associated with this developer account,
        and saves the results in a variable called $iaps that can be used for
        further processing.

    .EXAMPLE
        Get-InAppProducts | Format-InAppProducts

        Gets all of the IAP's associated with all applications in this developer account,
        and then displays it in a pretty-printed, formatted result.

        Creates a submission for an existing In-App Product.

        You cannot create a new In-App Product submission if there is an existing pending
        application submission for this IAP already.  You can use -Force to work around
        this.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER IapId
        The ID for the In-App Product that the new submission is for.

    .PARAMETER Force
        If this switch is specified, any existing pending submission for IapId
        will be removed before continuing with creation of the new submission.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the

        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        New-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 -NoStatus

        Creates a new In-App Product submission for the IAP 0ABCDEF12345 that
        is an exact clone of the currently published submission, but the request happens
        in the foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user until a
        response is returned from the REST request.
        If successful, will return back the PSCustomObject representing the newly created
        In-App Product submission.

    .EXAMPLE
        New-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 -Force

        First checks for any existing pending submission for the IAP 0ABCDEF12345.
        If one is found, it will be removed.  After that check has completed, this will create

function Update-InAppProductSubmission
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a new submission for an existing In-App Product on the developer account
        by cloning the existing submission and modifying specific parts of it.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a new submission for an existing In-App Product on the developer account
        by cloning the existing submission and modifying specific parts of it. The
        parts that will be modified depend solely on the switches that are passed in.

        You cannot submit a new application submission if there is an existing pending
        application submission for this IAP already.  You can use -Force to work around
        this.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER IapId
        The ID for the In-App Product that the new submission is for.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionDataPath
        The file containing the JSON payload for the application submission.

    .PARAMETER PackagePath
        If provided, this package will be uploaded after the submission has been successfully
        created.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishMode
        Indicates how the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER TargetPublishDate
        Indicates when the submission will be published once it has passed certification.
        Specifying a value here is only valid when TargetPublishMode is set to 'SpecificDate'.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER Visibility
        Indicates the store visibility of the IAP once the submission has been published.
        The value specified here takes precendence over the value from SubmissionDataPath if
        -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility is specified.  If -UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        is not specified and the value 'Default' is used, this submission will simply use the
        value from the previous submission.

    .PARAMETER AutoCommit
        If this switch is specified, will automatically commit the submission
        (which starts the certification process) once the Package has been uploaded
        (if PackagePath was specified), or immediately after the submission has been modified.

    .PARAMETER SubmissionId
        If a submissionId is provided, instead of trying to clone the currently published
        submission and operating against that clone, this will operate against an already
        existing pending submission (that was likely cloned previously).

    .PARAMETER Force
        If this switch is specified, any existing pending submission for IapId
        will be removed before continuing with creation of the new submission.

    .PARAMETER UpdateListings
        Replaces the listings array in the final, patched submission with the listings array
        from SubmissionDataPath.  Ensures that the images originally part of each listing in the
        cloned submission are marked as "PendingDelete" in the final, patched submission.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePublishModeAndVisibility
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath:
           targetPublishMode, targetPublishDate and visibility.

    .PARAMETER UpdatePricingAndAvailability
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath:
            base pricing, market-specific pricing and sales pricing information.

    .PARAMETER UpdateProperties
        Updates the following fields using values from SubmissionDataPath:
            product lifetime, content type, keywords, tag

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json"

        Creates a new submission for the In-App Product 0ABCDEF12345, that is a clone of
        the currently published submission.
        Even though "c:\foo.json" was provided, because no switches were specified to indicate
        what to copy from it, the cloned submission was not further modified, and is thus still
        an exact copy of the currently published submission.
        If successful, will return back the pending submission id and url that should be
        used with Upload-SubmissionPackage.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json" -UpdateProperties -NoStatus

        Creates a new submission for the In-App Product 0ABCDEF12345, that is a clone of
        the currently published submission.
        The properties of the submission will be updated to match those defined in c:\foo.json.
        The request happens in the foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user
        until a response is returned from the REST request.
        If successful, will return back the pending submission id and url that
        should be used with Upload-SubmissionPackage.

    .EXAMPLE
        Update-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 "c:\foo.json" "c:\foo.zip" -AutoCommit -SubmissionId 1234567890123456789 -UpdateListings

        Retrieves submission 1234567890123456789 from the IAP  0ABCDEF12345, updates the mestadata
        listing to match those in c:\foo.json.  If successful, this then attempts to upload "c:\foo.zip"
        (which would contain the listing icons).  If that is also successful, it then goes ahead and
        commits the submission so that the certification process can start. The pending
        submissionid and url that were used with with Upload-SubmissionPackage
        are still returned in this scenario, even though the upload url can no longer actively be used.

    .OUTPUTS
        An array of the following two objects:
            System.String - The id for the new pending submission
            System.String - The URL that the package needs to be uploaded to.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Replaces the content of an existing In-App Product submission with the supplied
        submission content.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Replaces the content of an existing In-App Product submission with the supplied
        submission content.
    
        This should be called after having cloned an In-App Product submission via
        New-InAppProductSubmission.

        The ID of the submission being updated/replaced will be inferred by the
        ID's defined in UpdatedSubmission.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/StoreBroker

    .PARAMETER IapId
        The ID for the In-App Product that the submission is for.

    .PARAMETER UpdatedSubmission
        The updated IAP submission content that should be used to replace the
        existing submission content.  The Submission ID will be determined from this.

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
        If provided, this will be used as the AccessToken for authentication with the
        REST Api as opposed to requesting a new one.

    .PARAMETER NoStatus
        If this switch is specified, long-running commands will run on the main thread
        with no commandline status update.  When not specified, those commands run in
        the background, enabling the command prompt to provide status information.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 $submissionBody

        Inspects $submissionBody to retrieve the id of the submission in question, and then replaces
        the entire content of that existing submission with the content specified in $submissionBody.

    .EXAMPLE
        Set-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 $submissionBody -NoStatus

        Inspects $submissionBody to retrieve the id of the submission in question, and then replaces
        the entire content of that existing submission with the content specified in $submissionBody.
        The request happens in the foreground and there is no additional status shown to the user
        until a response is returned from the REST request.

        for publication, with the console window showing progress while awaiting
        for the response from the REST request.

    .EXAMPLE
        Commit-InAppProductSubmission 0ABCDEF12345 1234567890123456789 -NoStatus

        Marks the pending submission 1234567890123456789 to start the approval process
        for publication, but the request happens in the foreground and there is no
        additional status shown to the user until a response is returned from the REST
        request.

    .NOTES
        This uses the "Complete" verb to avoid Powershell import module warnings, but this
        actually only *commits* the submission.  The decision to publish or not is based
        entirely on the contents of the payload included when calling New-InAppProductSubmission.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Auto-checks an In-App Product submission for status changes every 60 seconds with optional
        email notification.

        The monitoring will automatically end if the submission enters a failed state, or once

        This is a pure proxy for Start-ApplicationSubmissionMonitor.  The only benefit that
        it provides is that it makes IapId a required parameter and puts it positionally in
        the appropriate place.  We can't accomplish that with normal parameter sets since all the
        parameters are strings and thus can't be differentiated.
